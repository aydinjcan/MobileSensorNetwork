IMPORTANT: You need CVX installed in Matlab before runnig the code. CVX is free and can be download from http://cvxr.com/cvx/

Run "UnicycleSimulation.m" in Matlab to simulate a formation of robots with unicycle dynamics. Feel free to change the initial conditions, the desired formation, and the number of unicycles.

The simulation video is automatically saved in the "SavedFigs" folder. You can increase the number of simulation time samples in the code to get a smoother video. 

Note: Our distributed collision avoidance strategy prevents inter-agent collisions. However, this could cause deadlock in certain scenarios. Try to start the agents further apart if they did not converge to the desired formation.

This package is tested in MATLAB R2017b, 64-bit Windows 7 OS.
